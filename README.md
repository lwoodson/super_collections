# Ruby Super Collections #
These are my extensions to ruby standard collection type objects that I've
found recurringly useful.  I really should say extension, as to start there is
a single method added to the Array class.

## Usage ##
You can import all the extensions
```ruby
require 'super_collections'
```

Or the extensions for a specific class
```ruby
require 'super_collections/array'
```

Methods added to the collections classes are documented via RDOC in the source
code.
